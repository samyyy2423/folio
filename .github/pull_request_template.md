## Checklist

- [ ] Every engine still says the same thing: the VM, the JIT, WebAssembly and machine code.
- [ ] New behaviour has tests.
- [ ] A design decision has its own numbered section in DESIGN.md.
- [ ] After changing `tools/`, I ran `node make-stdlib.mjs`; after an engine or `index.html`, `node make-web.mjs`.
