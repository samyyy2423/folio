// It takes the newest moth-*.vsix here, or the one it's given. moth is MOTH's, or the repository's own (made by
// node bootstrap.mjs); it's copied into a folder with spaces in its name, as Program Files has, and moth.path
// set to it. Without one, only the tests that need no moth run. MOTH_VSCODE_VERSION picks VS Code's version
// (stable, the newest, if it isn't set), which is kept in .vscode-test/ for next time.
