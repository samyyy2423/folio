"""A Jupyter kernel for Folio (DESIGN §122). Each cell runs through `folio kernel` as `folio notebook` runs a
Markdown file's blocks: a cell has what the cells before it made, a cell whose last line is a value shows it,
and a cell that fails keeps nothing it made. What a cell says comes as it's said, its mistakes come as
Jupyter's errors, `ask` asks in the notebook, and stopping a cell (Jupyter's interrupt) stops only that cell:
what the cells before it made stays.

    python folio_kernel.py install                 # this folder as the "Folio" kernel, for this user
    python folio_kernel.py install --sys-prefix    # or for this Python's environment (a virtualenv's, conda's)
    jupyter lab                                   # then a new notebook, Folio

folio is found where the FOLIO variable says, else on PATH. What cells may do is FOLIO_KERNEL_ALLOW, the --allow
flags `folio run` takes, "--allow-all" if it isn't set: a notebook's code is the person's own, as a Python
kernel's is. FolioSession and execute need nothing but Python; FolioKernel needs ipykernel.

How it talks to `folio kernel`: a line on its input names a file holding a cell's code. Before the cell runs,
`folio kernel` writes a line of byte 1 and "folio-cell"; then the cell's output and mistakes come as they're
written; then a line of byte 1 and "folio-done" on the error output, and one of byte 1 and "folio-done ok" or
"folio-done failed" on the output. The cell's program has `folio kernel`'s input, so when its output stops part
of the way through a line (a Folio program only does that when it asks), that's a question, whose answer is
written to the input as a line.
