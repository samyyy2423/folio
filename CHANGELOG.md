# Changelog

What changed in each release of Moth, newest first. Each version links to its release on GitHub, which has
the downloads and their SHA-256 sums. [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) says what a version number promises,
and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) has the reasons behind each change, a section for each.

## Not released yet

- **`moth build --target wasm`** makes `<file>.wasm`, a WebAssembly module, from
  [`wasm.moth`](wasm.moth): Moth's WebAssembly back end, now written in Moth too, which makes exactly the
  bytes the playground's WebAssembly engine makes. `runWasm` in `moth.js` runs one.
- **Fixed:** on the WebAssembly engine, a function that used a variable from outside it only in `ask`'s
  question, `wait`'s amount or `play note`'s note or time found it had no value.
- **The standard library's reference**, at [samyyy2423.github.io/moth/docs/](https://samyyy2423.github.io/moth/docs/):
  a page for each library, with what it's for and each of its functions, what it takes and an example with
  what it says, and a search of all 807. It's made from the libraries' own comments by `node make-docs.mjs`,
  and the tests fail when it's behind them. Every public function now has a comment, so the editors' hovers
  say what each does too.
- **Workers: every core.** `start work(x) on another core` runs the call on a worker, a thread with memory of
  its own, given copies of what it's called with and of the program's variables; `wait for` gives a copy of
  what it gave back, or fails with its mistake. In a program `moth build` makes, workers run at the same
  moment on as many cores as there are, on Windows and Linux; in the playground, as tasks do, one after
  another, giving the same.
- **A web server for many people.** `server.moth` serves many connections at once, so a slow client holds up
  no one, keeps them open for the next request (HTTP/1.1 keep-alive), answers requests sent together in
  order, and limits how long a request takes and how big it is (`set_timeout`, `set_idle_timeout`,
  `set_most_bytes`, `set_most_connections`, `set_most_requests`, `set_keep_alive`). A request now has its
  `version`. `serve_on_workers(8080, answer, 4)`, or `set_workers(4)`, answers on 4 workers. From 10,500
  requests a second to 85,000, on one thread.
- **Trusted packages.** `moth.sums`, beside `moth.packages`, keeps the SHA-256 of each package's files.
  `moth add` and `moth update` write it and `moth get` checks it, so a package changed in `packages/`, or
  changed where it comes from, is found. A package's own `moth.sums` is checked for the packages it brings.
  A `moth.packages` with no sums gets them from the next `moth get`.
- **Signed packages.** `moth add`, `moth get` and `moth update` take `--signed`, which accepts only a
  package whose commit, or the tag it was asked for at, has a signature git trusts.
- **`moth audit`** checks a program's packages against the advisories in the package index and says which
  are about the commits they're at.
- **Packages are checked out the same way everywhere.** moth tells git to keep line ends as they were
  committed and to write a symbolic link as a small file, whatever the system or the person's own git
  settings, so a package's files, and their sum, are the same on Windows and Linux.
- **Documents for depending on Moth:** a language specification ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md)), a stability promise
  ([VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md)), a security policy ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)) and this changelog.
- **Types you can add.** An input can be `a dog` (a record the kind dog makes) or `a list of numbers` (or of
  `text`, `dogs`, `lists of numbers`...), and a function can say what it `gives`. A run checks what it
  always could; `moth check`, the playground and the editors check the rest before the program runs, as
  "doesn't fit", in red. They also know what a function returns, so `f() + 1`, where f gives nothing, will
  fail. Code that says nothing is checked as it was, and `gives` stays a name.
- **`moth check` works the types out**, as the playground's checker does, and says what it says word for
  word, but for what rests on a value written out (`1 / 0`).
- **`moth lsp`, a language server**, for any editor: problems as you type, formatting as `moth tidy` writes,
  the outline, go to definition in the file or a file it uses, hovers that say what a variable holds and
  what a function takes and gives, and completion, after `rex's` too.
- **Every major editor.** The VS Code extension asks `moth lsp` for the outline, definitions, hovers and
  completion where moth is installed. New: a plugin folder for Neovim, settings for Helix, an extension for
  Zed, a tree-sitter grammar for their colours, and how to use JetBrains' IDEs through LSP4IJ
  ([editors/README.md](editors/README.md)).
- **`ask for 64 bytes`** gives the input's next 64 bytes without waiting for a line's end, in programs moth
  builds.
- **The VS Code extension, ready for the Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX.** It finds moth from the
  `moth.path` setting, or else the PATH (`moth.exe` on Windows, paths with spaces too), and where there's none
  says so once, with a button to the releases, while colours, snippets, problems and Format Document go on
  without it. Run and Build keep what the program said in the terminal once it has ended, as tasks, which
  tasks.json can have too. It has an icon, a Marketplace page with a picture of each feature, and a changelog
  of its own; CI packs it with vsce and tests it in VS Code itself, and a workflow publishes it when it's run
  by hand ([docs/publishing-the-extension.md](docs/publishing-the-extension.md)).
- **A debugger in your editor.** A debug adapter for `moth debug` gives VS Code (*Moth: Debug this file*, or
  F5), Neovim, Helix and JetBrains' IDEs breakpoints, stepping, the calls in progress and the variables.
- **Libraries for a company's work.** `postgres.moth` and `mysql.moth` query PostgreSQL and MySQL over their
  own protocols, each value sent apart from the SQL, and `redis.moth` talks to Redis, all three on
  `wire.moth`. `s3.moth` keeps objects in S3 and the stores that speak its language, `jwt.moth` makes and
  checks JSON Web Tokens, `oauth.moth` signs a person in with OAuth 2 and PKCE, and `yaml.moth` reads and
  writes YAML. CI tests them against real PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis and MinIO servers.

## [1.11.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.11.0) (2026-11-04)

A standard library like Python's, secure networking, every core at once, and a faster web.

- **The standard library goes everywhere.** moth carries it, so `use "json.moth"` works in any folder. New
  since 1.10: `http.moth`, `websocket.moth`, `sockets.moth` with TLS and IPv6, HTTPS for `server.moth`,
  `email.moth` (SMTP, POP3 and IMAP), `zip.moth`, `xml.moth`, `toml.moth`, `options.moth`, `log.moth`,
  `collections.moth`, `lists.moth`, `stats.moth`, `zones.moth`, `base64.moth`, `secrets.moth`, `big.moth`,
  `fractions.moth`, `sets.moth`, `images.moth`, `crypto.moth` and `charts.moth`.
- **The language.** Inputs a call can leave out, functions with no name, lists built from lists,
  `items 2 to 4 of xs`, `to the power of`, `rounded down` and `rounded up`, `remainder of 17 divided by 5`,
  `x with 2 decimals`, a record's own functions, lists as sets, `either way` (like Python's `finally`),
  inputs by name, unpacking, `match`, steps in `for each`, kinds with `give`, and how a kind is shown.
- **Every core at once.** `tools/cores.moth` shares a list's items out between copies of the program, a core
  each. `job has ended` asks whether a task is done, and `sync.moth` has locks, semaphores, flags and queues.
- **Tools.** `moth profile`, `moth coverage` and `moth notebook`. `moth debug` stops at a mistake. Packages
  can be asked for at a version (`github.com/someone/thing@v1.2`), and `moth search` reads a package index.
- **Shipping.** `moth build --web` makes a page that runs the program in a browser. `moth build --installer`
  makes a setup program, and `--sign` signs each program built.
- **More of C.** Small and unsigned whole numbers, structures by value, and callbacks from any thread.
- **A faster web.** The playground runs programs on WebAssembly GC where the browser has it, up to 5 times as
  fast as 1.10 on lists, records and text.
- **Fixes.** A task's thread could crash on a Linux computer with one core. The profiler reports however a
  program ends. Reading text a letter at a time no longer counts from the start each time.
- **License.** Moth is under the Apache License 2.0 from this release. Earlier releases stay under MIT.

## [1.10.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.10.0) (2026-11-03)

C libraries, the system's own controls, a shell, tasks and faster machine code.

- **The Moth shell.** `moth` on its own reads Moth a line at a time.
- **C libraries.** `use the library "sqlite3" ... end` calls a C library's functions, with structures,
  callbacks and floats, on Windows and Linux (`--allow-libraries`). `tools/sqlite.moth` keeps a database.
- **The system's own controls.** `tools/windows.moth` (Windows) and `tools/linux.moth` (GTK), with
  `tools/ui.moth` picking the right one.
- **More tools.** `server.moth`, `tasks.moth`, `text.moth`, `dates.moth`, `system.moth`, `hash.moth`
  (SHA-256) and `game.moth`.
- **Tasks.** `set job to start count(10)` runs a call on a thread of its own, and `wait for job` gives what
  it returned.
- **Values in text.** `"Hi, {name}!"`, with any value inside the braces.
- **A value's own functions and fields.** `rex's bark()` is `bark(rex)`, and `rex's name` is `name of rex`.
- **`moth debug`** stops a built program before each line, on command.
- **Packages.** `moth add`, `get`, `update`, `remove` and `packages`, and `use the package "json"`. A package
  is a Git repository, pinned at its commit in `moth.packages`.
- **VS Code.** `editors/vscode`: colours, problems as you type, Quick Fixes, formatting, the outline, and
  Run, Debug and Build.
- **Shipping a program.** `moth build --icon app.png --version 1.2.0 --include data`.
- **Faster machine code.** Small functions are put in line, inputs go in registers, and lists, text and
  records are worked on where the code is. fib(32) takes 1.25 times C's time.

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.9.0) (2026-10-30)

Apps with real controls, and a window on Linux.

- **A window on Linux.** Drawings and apps show in a window on any X server, Xwayland and WSLg included,
  with nothing to install. Linux has no clipboard, drawing pad or file boxes yet.
- **Checkboxes, text areas, lists, dropdowns and sliders**, with handlers for each.
- **Choosing a file.** `choose a file to open` (or `to save`).
- **Editing what's typed**: the cursor, selecting, and cut, copy and paste.
- **Sending and JSON.** `send data to "https://..."`, `with headers`, `x as json` and `json from`.
- **Faster records.** A record made in one go is one block of memory.
- **Fixed:** in the Windows window, a button's handler also ran every 10 ms as if it were a timer.

## [1.8.1](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.8.1) (2026-10-30)

Security fixes for Windows. Update if you use 1.8 or earlier on Windows.

- **DLLs only from System32.** A file called `winhttp.dll`, `winmm.dll` or `gdiplus.dll` beside `moth.exe`,
  or beside a program it built, would have run inside it.
- **`run program` never runs a program from beside the running one.** A name with no folder is looked for in
  System32, then the Windows folder, then PATH, skipping empty entries.
- **No commands slipped into a batch file.** An argument to a `.bat` or `.cmd` file holding any of
  `" % ^ & | < > !` or a line break is refused, as cmd.exe would read it as a command (the same problem as
  Rust's CVE-2024-24576).
- **`load` reads very small and very large numbers** written with an exponent, in built programs.

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.8.0) (2026-10-30)

The time, saving, sound, buttons and pictures, and all of Moth in machine code.

- **The time and waiting.** `the time`, `the date`, `the clock`, `wait 2 seconds` and the rest.
- **Putting things in order.** `scores in order`, `in reverse order`, and `people in order by age`.
- **Saving and loading.** `save scores to "scores.txt"` and `load "scores.txt"`.
- **Sound.** `play note "C4" for 0.5 seconds`, a pitch in hertz, and `play a beep`.
- **Buttons and text boxes**, with handlers for clicks and Enter.
- **Pictures from files.** `draw picture "cat.png" at 0, 0`, PNG or BMP.
- **All of Moth in machine code.** Units, tables, charts, colours, folders and going online.
- **`moth test` finds the tests itself** when no file is named.
- **Speed.** About as fast as C and Rust, except on function calls, and 10 to 200 times as fast as Python.

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.7.0) (2026-10-30)

Drawing, random numbers and the whole moth command.

- **Drawing, apps and the handwriting pad in machine code**, in a window of their own on Windows.
- **Random numbers in machine code**, the same as the playground's for the same seed (`MOTH_SEED`).
- **The whole moth command.** `moth run`, `moth tidy`, `moth check` and `moth test`, written in Moth.
- **New phrases.** `say ... to the error output`, `stop the program with 2`, `run program ... with ...`
  (and `keeping its output`), and `remove the file`. `--allow-run` lets a program start another without
  asking.
- **`expect` in machine code.**
- **The naming trap, fixed.** A `set` in a function changes a variable outside it only if that variable is
  made above the function. This can change what an old program does.
- **Fixes.** `stop the program` in an app's handler ends the program. A file used as two names keeps both
  copies' functions.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.6.0) (2026-10-30)

Moth on its own: `moth` is a program of its own for Windows and Linux, which needs nothing else installed.

- **It builds itself.** `moth.moth` and `machine.moth`, made into machine code, are moth, and moth makes
  them again into exactly the same bytes. A Windows moth and a Linux moth build each other byte for byte.
- **Machine code takes nearly all of Moth**: functions inside functions and as values, files, `ask`,
  arguments and the `--allow` flags, and upper and lower case for every Unicode character.
- **A garbage collector.**
- **The handwriting network runs as a program of its own.**
- **Gone:** the Rust engine (`moth-native`) and the Node.js command line. Both are still in 1.5.1. The
  playground keeps its JavaScript engine.

## [starter-1](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/starter-1) (2026-10-29, pre-release)

The first standalone moth, built from commit 44c1dd5: a program of its own for Windows and Linux on x86-64
that compiles a Moth program into one, kept so that a moth can always build the next one.

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.5.1) (2026-10-29)

Closes five gaps in asking before files and going online.

- **`use` stays in the program's folder**, and a link inside it that leads out is refused.
- **`moth test` asks** as `moth run` does, and takes the same `--allow` flags.
- **Programs made by `moth build` ask too**, with the flags given to the build built in.
- **Flags can name what they allow**: `--allow-read=data,notes.txt`, `--allow-write=out`,
  `--allow-net=example.com`. A file is checked where it really is.
- **Redirects are asked about**, ten at most.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (2026-10-29)

Numbers and data the way people use them.

- **Numbers like a spreadsheet**, shown and compared to 15 significant digits, so `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.3`.
- **Units**: distances, times, weights and volumes, metric and imperial.
- **Tables and charts.** `read table "sales.csv"`, `total of`, `average of` and `draw chart of`.
- **Inputs that say what they are.** `to area with width as a number, ...` checks every call.
- **Asks before it touches your files.** A program asks before it reads a file, writes one or goes online,
  unless it was started with `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-net` or `--allow-all`. This changed
  how scripts run.
- **Reading websites.** `read "https://..."`.
- **Fix buttons** in the playground for misspelled names.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.4.0) (2026-10-29)

Moth without JavaScript.

- **moth-native**, Moth written again in Rust with no libraries, making the same bytecode as the JavaScript
  engines, and building into one WebAssembly file that needs only WASI.
- **Moth builds itself without JavaScript**: compiler.moth writes bytecode, byte for byte what the Rust
  compiler makes.
- **Bytecode files** (`.mothc`).
- **A new website** for the playground.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.3.0) (2026-10-29)

Apps: programs that answer keys, clicks and time.

- **Events and timers**: `when a key is pressed`, `when the mouse is clicked`, `every 100 milliseconds`.
- **More to draw with**: `move to`, filled boxes and circles, text, and `clear`.
- **Random numbers.**
- **The playground runs apps live**, with Snake and Paint as examples.
- **`moth build --web`** makes one HTML file that runs the program.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.2.0) (2026-10-29)

Tools for writing real programs.

- **Error trails** show the calls that led to a mistake.
- **`expect` and `moth test`.**
- **`moth fmt`**, and a Tidy button in the playground.
- **Faster WebAssembly** for bytes and dictionaries.
- **Real tools in `tools/`**: a Mandelbrot picture, a word counter and a JSON reader.
- **Fixed:** a built program names the right file for a mistake inside a file it uses.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.1.0) (2026-10-28)

What real programs need.

- **Catching mistakes** with `try ... if it fails with why ... end`.
- **Dictionaries**, `keys of`, and `x is in y`.
- **Modules**: `use "math.moth" as math`.
- **Files and arguments**: `read`, `read bytes`, `write ... to` and `arguments`.
- **Bytes and bits**: `100 bytes`, `bit and`, `shift x left by 2`, `0xFF` and `255 as hex`.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/samyyy2423/moth/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (2026-10-28)

The first release: a programming language that reads like plain English, written from scratch in JavaScript.

- **The language**: variables, lists, records, functions and closures, `if`, `repeat`, `for each`, `stop`,
  `fail with`, text helpers, `ask`, `use` and turtle drawing, with mistakes explained in plain words.
- **Three engines that must agree**: a bytecode virtual machine, a JIT to JavaScript, and a WebAssembly
  compiler.
- **A compiler written in Moth** that compiles itself to exactly the JIT's JavaScript.
- **Neural networks written in Moth**, and a handwriting reader.
- **Tools**: a checker, a time-travel debugger, the playground, and the `moth` command.
