# Builds folio_<version>_amd64.deb, for Debian and Ubuntu, from a release's folio-linux, with dpkg-deb:
#
#     packaging/debian/build-deb.sh folio-linux 1.11.0 [folder]
#
# folio goes to /usr/bin/folio as it is, byte for byte, so the package holds the same program the release
# does, and its copyright and notices to /usr/share/doc/folio. folio is one static program, so the package
# depends on nothing; it suggests git and curl, which folio add, get and search run, and OpenSSL 3, which a
# program folio builds loads for a secure connection. Every file's time is SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH (else the time of
# this repository's last commit), so the same folio-linux and version make the same .deb on the same dpkg.

Description: programming language that reads like plain English
 Folio is a programming language that reads like plain English, small enough
 to learn in an afternoon. folio runs a program, builds it into a Linux or
 Windows program of its own as fast as C, and has a shell, a debugger, tests,
 packages, a language server and a standard library from web servers and
 databases to pictures and encryption.
 .
 folio is one static program. folio add, get and update run git, folio search
 runs curl, and a program that makes a secure connection loads OpenSSL 3.
