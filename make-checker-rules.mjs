// Makes checker-rules.folio: what each of the checker's rules (RULES in checker.js) does with a value of each
// type, for `folio check`, which works the types out as checker.js does but can't run vm.js (DESIGN §107).
//
//     node make-checker-rules.mjs
//
// Each line is a rule, what's fixed at its spot, and a type for each operand (a letter each: CODES), then what
// the rule does on SAMPLES' values of those types: the operands whose value (not just type) can change that, by
// place, and the message it stops with, if it does, by its number in the messages, which come after, a line
// each. A line for "type" gives what `+`, `-`, `*` or `/` gives. A name in a message (a field's) is @NAME@.
// The lines come by family, the text before a line's first |, or builtin| and the builtin's name, so folio check
// reads only the families a program needs: all 9,500 lines took it 19 ms, before it looked at the program.
// folio.test.js says when the file is behind.
