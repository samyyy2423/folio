// The lessons on learn.html, the page that teaches Folio a step at a time. Each has a title, what it teaches (as
// HTML), a program to run and change, and something to try. folio.test.js runs every program on every engine, so a
// lesson never shows code that doesn't work: `answers` are what a test types when the program asks, `fails` is
// the mistake a lesson means to show, and `draws` says the program draws, which the playground shows.

    title: "Say something",
    intro: `<p><code>say</code> shows whatever comes after it. Put words in quotes; numbers and sums need none. Put
      pieces side by side and they're joined exactly as written.</p>
      <p>Folio works to 15 digits, like a spreadsheet, so <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> is exactly <code>0.3</code>.</p>`,
    code: `say "Hello, world!"
say "2 + 3 is " 2 + 3

      <code>add</code> to it.</p>
      <p>Inside text, a name in braces is replaced by its value: <code>"Hi, {name}!"</code>.</p>`,

      else, and <code>else</code> catches the rest. A block ends with <code>end</code>.</p>

      true.</p>`,

      first (Folio counts from 1), and <code>for each ... in</code> goes through them all.</p>
      <p>The last line asks for an item that isn't there. Run it and read what Folio says: its mistakes are in
      plain words, and point at the line.</p>`,
